## Artist Statement

My work is highly driven by light and form of the natural world.

My research revolves around those visual details that are able to trigger emotions, being ancestral heritage, muscle memory functional for the survival of the human specie.

I am fascinated with shadows, chiaro-scuro and nature roundness, those smooth curves that evokes harmony and flow.

I work mostly with natural light and outdoors, focusing on composition and visually isolating subjects from their environment.

I have been described as someone who celebrates life through the timeless beauty contained in the details around us.

I feel the need and pursue the goal of producing charming images that warm the sometime dull and square aseptic cold environment of modern buildings, being them private homes, hotels, and public venues.

Delivering portable beauty, simplicity of geometrical shapes, shadows play.

Itâ€™s there, and in these elements, that I find my drive and fascination.
